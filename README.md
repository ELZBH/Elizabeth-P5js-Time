## Visual Music & Triangles

For this assignment, I wanted to use triangles as my formal element to create visual music. The initial inspiration I had was the concept of triangles overlaid like teeth, animated to draw closer and closer to the screen as frames play. To program this, I started with positioning triangles into the formation above. I made a different shape that I preferred. 

From here, I elected to use this accidental shape to create my visual music.

In class, one of the visual music works we watched reminded me of screen savers. Combining this shape with a screensaver concept, I ended up with two different final designs. They both use the random() function to change the colors of the triangles as they are added to the sketch. Below is my favorite of the two.

This relies on the core shape, instantiated with four variables that are each twice the previous, and uses the borders of the canvas and the growing proportions to represent motion by adding a triangle every frame. After this core concept was established, I added variables to track how many cycles had passed, which allowed me to apply both erasing and coloring changes to the program.
